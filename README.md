# Big Data with examples and Types:
 Big data means collection of large data which cannot be processed or analysed by traditional data base management systems.
 " It is different from an ordinary data because of
 its high volume, high velocity, and heterogeneous variety."[1]

 ### Examples:
 1. Social media like twiter, instagram, facebook generated huge data in the form of text, images and videos.
 2. Demographic data
 3. Transactional data
 4. Customer created feedback/ reviews texts.
 5. Web data
 6. Healthcare data
 7. Sensor data - as everything is becoming more digitalized(" Smart"), huge amount of data is being generated in indutries and day to day lives.

 ### Types:
 1. Batch data - This is a type of data which is collected over time.
 2. Stream data - This is live or real time data
 3. Spatio temporal - real time, time varying data generated by satellities, GPS data and wireless communication devices.
 "Recent rapid development of wireless communication, mobile computing, global navigational satellite systems (GNSS), and spatially enabled sensors is leading to an exponential growth of available spatio-temporal data produced continuously at high speed."[2]

## 6 ‘V’s of Big Data (define each) 
#### Volume:
Big data itself means enormous amount of data, which cant be handled by traditional systems and requires specialized tools and techniques to process the data. "With regards to Volume, it refers to that the data scale is very large, ranging from several PB (1000TB) to  ZB(a billion TB)"[3]
#### Velocity:
This basically refers to how fast the data is being generated or how fast the data is being processed. For example, the data generated online( through websites/apps) is high speed data.
#### Variety:
With increase in the sources of data, various forms of data is being generated like text, images, videos, graphs, audio. These can be classified as structured(tabular data,relational data), unstructured(text, images, audio, video,logs) and semi-structured data (XML,JSON data, graphs).
#### Value:
This refers to meaningful or usefulness property of data. The data can provide more insights if it has more value. "The signicance of big data is not the  great volume, but rather the huge value. How to extract the  value from massive data through powerful algorithms, is the key to improve competitiveness".[3]
#### Variability: 
This is simply, the inconsistencies in data or how spread out the data is. The data can also be said it is variable if there are so many different types and sources of data.
#### Veracity: 
This refers to the accuracy of data / Trust in data that is being used for analysis. If the data is inaccurate/ incomplete then it will be difficult to obtain insights from it.
