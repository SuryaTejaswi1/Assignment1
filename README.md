 3. Spatio temporal - real time, time varying data generated by satellities, GPS data and wireless communication devices.
 "Recent rapid development of wireless communication, mobile computing, global navigational satellite systems (GNSS), and spatially enabled sensors is leading to an exponential growth of available spatio-temporal data produced continuously at high speed."[2]
